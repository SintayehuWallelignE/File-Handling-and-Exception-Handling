How to Use the File Processor
Save the files: Save the file_processor.py file and the input.txt file in the same directory on your computer.

Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the script with the following command:

python file_processor.py

Enter the filename: When prompted, type input.txt and press Enter.

The program will then create a new file named input_modified.txt with the processed content.

To test the error handling, you can run the script and enter a filename that does not exist. The program will catch the error and display a friendly message.
